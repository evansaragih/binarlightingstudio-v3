          The fundamental Philosophy of BINAR is taken from the meaning
          of word <i>BINAR</i> (in Bahasa), or a twinkle (in English),
          which means "emission of light". This combined with the
          character itself, which is flexible, does not require a
          propagation medium, can spread the colour spectrum when it
          passes through a prism, can reflect when it meets a mirror,
          can be formed, and can fill spaces and fields. BINAR is
          independent and can always develop and follow situations and
          conditions flexibly.
